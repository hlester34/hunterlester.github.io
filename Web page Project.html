<h4 style="font-size:130%;">NFL Career</h4>
</div>
<p>Julio Jones decided to leave college after his junior year and enter the NFL draft. Because of his 
incredible college career, Jones was picked sixth overall in the 2011 NFL draft by the Atlanta Falcons. 
In his first season in the NFL, he started at wide receiver for the Falcons and recorded almost a 
thousand yards receiving with eight touchdowns. He followed that up with over a thousand yards and ten 
touchdowns in his second season and was selected to his first pro bowl. He suffered a broken foot after 
playing only five games in 2013 and was out for the rest of the season. He came back strong in the 
2014 season posting career highs in both receptions and yards and getting selected to the pro bowl for 
the second time in his career. He posted career high numbers again in the 2015 season, recording the 
second most receiving yards ever in a single season in the NFL while also breaking the Falcons record 
for yards in a single season. This trend of excellent play has carried over into 2016. Through ten games 
this season, Jones is on track for another record breaking season and his fourth pro bowl appearence.</p>

</div>
<p>Everyone knows Julio Jones makes a huge impact on the football field, but not many know about the 
impact he makes off the field. Jones is frequently doing whatever he can to better the community 
around him and help those in need. He is also a great role model for all of the young football fans 
who look up to him by never getting in trouble off the field and always trying to positively impact 
his community. Julio is involved with many charities and never hesitates to attend an event whenever 
he can. Not only is he continuing to do his part in the community, but he is also going back to 
school to finish his degree at alabama. Julio Jones is an excellent member of society and has a very 
future on and off the football field. He is well on his way to the NFL Hall of Fame. Hopefully we will 
have the oppurtunity to watch Julio play for many more years, but his football career wil eventually 
end and all we can hope for until then is that he helps bring a Super Bowl Championship to Atlanta.
